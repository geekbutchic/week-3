# `What I Learned in Week 3`
## `JavaScript` 
This week we took a step back from `HTML` and `CSS`   and started the week with setting up our computers.

We created a `GitHub` account and focused on terminal commands that would expedite the way we would interface with our computer.

### `Command Review` 
```
mkdir 👉🏻 make directory 

touch 👉🏻 create a file

mv 👉🏻 rename a file 

rm -rf 👉🏻 remove a file permanently

../ 👉🏻 move up one level

cd ~ 👉🏻 start from beginning
```
### `GitHub Terminal Commands` 
```
git add 👉🏻 add the files that were changed (place in box)

git commit -m 'comment' 👉🏻 commit the added files (add label to box)

git push 👉🏻 push up the changes (send package)
```
This information would be essential in expediting changes that were made to our code.

## `JavaScript` 
JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

`ES6/2015 - ES11/2020` 👉🏻 Known as Modern JavaScript

`We learned about Primitive Data Types`
1. `Number` 👉🏻 used for decimals and integers `let age = 23`

2. `String` 👉🏻 sequence of characters 👉🏻 used for text `let firstName = 'Jonas'` it is important to note for a string to not be considered a variable it wil need quotation marks wrapping the string.
   
3. `Boolean` 👉🏻 Logical value type that can be  `true` or `false` 👉🏻 used for decision making ```let fullAge = true```

4. `Undefined` 👉🏻 Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined `(empty value)`

## `Declaring a Variable`
Declaring a variable is one way of giving a variable a value.
```
let myBestFriend = 'Tom';
console.log(myBestFriend); //? Tom 
```
We can also reassign that variable.

```
myBestFriend = 'Grace';
console.log(myBestFriend); //? Grace
```
We no longer need the `let` when reassigning the variable.

It was an important week as we forge ahead into the wonderful world of `JavaScript`
